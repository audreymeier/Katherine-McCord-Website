      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <img class="kitty-smiling" src="Kitty McCord Face.jpg" alt="photo of Katherine McCord smiling at the camera">

      <section class="bio">
        <p>I have two books of poetry--<i>Island</i> and <i>Living Room</i> (prose poems)--a lyric essay memoir, <i>My CIA</i>; a poetry chapbook, <i>Muse Annie</i>; and a literary memoir, <i>Run Scream Unbury Save</i>, that is just out. <i>My CIA</i> was named a top ten book of 2012 by <i>The Review of Art, Literature, Philosophy and Humanities</i> and added to their ongoing list of Great Nonfiction reads. It won a Baker Artist Award; was showcased on Maryland Public Television’s, An Artworks Special; and was featured through an art installation co-produced by Maryland Institute College of Art’s MFA in Curatorial Practice in early December 2013 in Baltimore.</p>

        <p>I have published widely in literary journals and magazines, such as four of my prose poems in <i>American Poetry Review</i>, those poems I later melded into a short short, published in <i>Caketrain</i>. I have an MFA in Poetry and an MA in Poetry. In 2011 and 2014, I won Maryland Individual Artist Awards (state grants in creative writing in poetry). I have been awarded finalist/semi-finalist status in the Emerging Writer Fellowship Competition, The Writer's Center, Maryland; the Joaquin Miller Cabin Reading Series, Washington, DC; the Autumn House Press Open Competition in Poetry; The "Discovery"/The Nation Poetry Contest; the Poet Lore Narrative Poetry Competition; The Chester H. Jones Foundation National Poetry Competition; The Maryland Poetry Review Poetry Contest; and the fellowship competition, Summer Literary Seminars in Lithuania and Kenya, 2013. I was also chosen by those of Quarter After Eight as their representative of the Lyric Essay. Finally, recently, I won the Gabehart Prize in (Creative) Nonfiction for an excerpt from my manuscript, <i>Run Scream Unbury Save</i>; was named one of three finalists for the Tony Quagliano International Poetry Award; was awarded a Hoffer Legacy (Creative) Nonfiction Award for <i>My CIA</i>; was named a finalist for my manuscript of prose poetry, <i>Muse Annie</i>, for C&R’s Summer Chapbook Contest; was named a finalist for Muse Annie for NDR’s Poetry Chapbook Competition; was named a finalist for the Faulkner Wisdom Competition for an excerpt from my book-length lyric essay in progress; was named a finalist for an excerpt from <i>Run Scream Unbury Save</i> for the Frank McCourt Memoir Prize; won the Autumn House Press Open Book Award in Creative Nonfiction, for my literary memoir manuscript, <i>Run Scream Unbury Save</i>, which Martone called “Brilliant” so that they published it as of February 7, 2017; was published very recently on <i>Essay Daily</i> for a piece I did on “menus” for my book and others; and, finally, <i>Muse Annie</i>, a chapbook of poems, is now out from Kattywompus Press. All my books have received beautifully celebratory reviews. </p>

        <p>I have been teaching college English, from Creative Writing to Literature to Composition, both online and in the traditional classroom, for credit at universities and noncredit for various worthy online venues, to all kinds of student populations.</p>
